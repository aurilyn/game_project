completed so far:
turn based rps combat
saving the game into a json file (add more stuff to save as the game goes on)

what to do next:
after defeating one mob, fight the next one
add in a store to buy something
store will let player use gold to buy new items
can also use gold to buy new cards
remove cards
using an attack removes it from the deck for that fight only
refreshes the deck at the beginning of the next fight
create some items / new attacks
